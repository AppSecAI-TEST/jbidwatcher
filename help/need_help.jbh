<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
I've been unemployed for the last three months, and have reached the end of
my safety net.  Thankfully interviews have picked up, and I've been able to
sell some things off (on eBay, naturally), but I can't make my next payment
on the house, or pay bills.  I wouldn't be asking if it weren't a dire need
as I know one of the reasons many people use JBidwatcher is that it's free.<br>
<br>
<h2>What happens if I don't?</h2>
Nothing happens; I'm not going to lock people out, or take it down anytime
soon.  JBidwatcher has been a labor of love for me for 9 years now.  The
site hosting JBidwatcher is paid for through mid-April.  I'll keep developing,
trying to <a href="http://svn.jbidwatcher.com">fix bugs</a>,
<a href="http://jbidwatcher.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8037-jbidwatcher/overview">handle tickets</a>,
and respond to <a href="http://forum.jbidwatcher.com">forum posts</a> and
email as much as I can.<br>
<br>
I'm just asking for help.<br>
<h2>JBidwatcher is great, but are there any other perks?</h2>
I'm trying to put some together.  I'm looking at building a mailing list
from the Paypal donations to auto-notify folks on new version releases.<br>
<br>
I'm also creating a web site that will optionally dovetail with JBidwatcher,
allowing you to track your items remotely, automatically upload error logs,
report exceptions, and maybe even be a parser-of-last-resort to recognize
eBay bid-result pages and listings.  It wouldn't store your username or
password, snipe, bid, or buy for you, all that would remain in your
JBidwatcher instance for your security.  Because of bandwidth and storage
costs, it will have a low subscription fee, but I'll give everybody who
donates now an initial 6 or 3 month subscription to it once it launches.<br>
<br>
I believe in giving value; the core JBidwatcher application is certainly
part of that, but I want to do more.  As I find things that I can do, I will.
