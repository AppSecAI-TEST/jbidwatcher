Greetings,<br>
As a software package, JBidwatcher has reached a point in its growth
that makes supporting it somewhat difficult.  The program now has over
3,500 regular users and 25,000 downloaders per release, all of whom are a
button-click away from contacting the author.  This has been both a
wonderful experience, and also very hard to manage at times.<br>
<br>
Since working on JBidwatcher is not my day job, support has grown
tough to keep up with.  Recent versions of JBidwatcher have a feature
that provides some potential to realize a return on the investment of
many years of development and user support.<br>
<br>
Specifically, from 0.9.7 on, JBidwatcher includes optional code to
place bids and snipes through eBay's affiliate program.  This means I
may get a few nickels per bid placed (at no cost to you), depending on
how many bids are placed per month through JBidwatcher.  Now I know
very well that this raises privacy concerns; be assured I get no
information about what users are bidding on, or even who my users are.
I do get statistics in aggregate of how many bids happened in a day,
and how many items are being viewed overall, but no specific user or
item information.  Even so it is completely opt-in, of course.
Clicking 'Accept' below lets JBidwatcher use the affiliate program.
It can easily be turned off in the Configuration Manager later.  There
is no other change in functionality, and I will never release a
version which requires use of the affiliate program.<br>
<br>
eBay may not even allow this to happen, in which case there will be a
newer version disabling it, but given the circumstances I must at least
try, lest JBidwatcher become a victim of its own success.<br>
<br>
Thank you to all my users, whatever you decide, for your trust and
your passion for my software.  It has inspired and uplifted me for
these last five years, and hopefully will do so for many more.<br>
