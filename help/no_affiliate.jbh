Greetings,<br>
I appreciate your choice to help out the JBidwatcher project by enabling
the affiliate mode in JBidwatcher.  It was good for a while, but eBay has
finally spoken, and they have decreed that it's not to be.  In their latest
affiliate agreement, it explicitly disallows sniping software from being
part of the affiliate program.<br>
<br>
This version (0.9.9) therefore no longer has the affiliate mode available
in it.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your support of my independent software development efforts.
It means a lot to me, and encourages me that people really do find value
in JBidwatcher.  The program remains available free, with my great and
repeated thanks to all who participated.<br>
