<h2>Personal/Financial Note</h2>I'm a very happy user of <A HREF="https://www.paypal.com/auction/pal=cyberfox%40users.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">PayPal</A>, and recommend them for your auction payment needs.<br><br>If you're already a PayPal member, and find JBidWatcher really useful, you could <a href="<%donate%>">donate a small sum of money</a>, for which I would be extremely grateful.<br><br>
For more information and hints about the program, or to report bugs or request features, visit the JBidwatcher homepage, by clicking on Jay, above, or going to <a href="http://www.jbidwatcher.com">http://www.jbidwatcher.com</a> in your browser.<br><br>
As the number of users has grown, my ability to reply to every email has decreased.  I really do try, and I love hearing from people using my program, but I can't promise I'll always respond.  Feel free, in any case, to <a href="mailto:jbcomments@vixen.com">email me</a> with comments, positive and negative, about the program!<br>
